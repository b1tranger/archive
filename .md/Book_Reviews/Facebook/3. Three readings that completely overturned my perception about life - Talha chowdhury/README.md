Three readings that completely overturned my perception about life last year. If you’re in your 20s, don’t skip this.

1.

# How to live 24 hours a day by Arnold Bennett

This little short book-like reading is about 50 pages. The title will deceive you into thinking that this is about productivity or actually living 24hrs a day. But the reading goes into much more than that. One of my favorite takeaways from this reading is: 

“It is hard to have one's watch stolen, but one reflects that the thief of the watch became a thief from causes of heredity and environment which are as interesting as they are scientifically comprehensible; and one buys another watch, if not with joy, at any rate with a philosophy that makes bitterness impossible. One loses, in the study of cause and effect, that absurd air which so many people have of being always shocked and pained by the curiousness of life. Such people live amid human nature as if human nature were a foreign country full of awful foreign customs. But, having reached maturity, one ought surely to be ashamed of being a stranger in a strange land!”

# First Principles Thinking - Farnam Street Blog

Farnam Street blogs are a gold mine for those who seek true understanding of the world. Those who read to learn, not to just complete a syllabus. First Principles Thinking is a powerful mental model used by history’s great thinkers such as Elon Musk to break down complex problems into its non-divisible parts. If you want to learn just one mental model in life, learn this one.

# What to do with your life - Julian Shapiro

Julian is a brilliant writer and this essay is a living proof of that. Too many of us are running in the wrong direction—no matter how successful we are in that direction. It takes us years to realize that mistake and by that time, it’s usually too late. Julian breaks down the core values we should be thinking about when deciding what to do with our life and it only takes you 15 mins to do it. Here’s a favorite quote from the reading: 

“It took 15 minutes to realize that those are the things I care about. What's crazy is that I didn’t do this exercise until I was 27. In 27 years, I never took 15 minutes to be more deliberate about my pursuit of... life itself.”

Here’s another: 

“What choices can you make today that minimize the regret you'll feel as an 80-year-old looking back on your life? When you minimize future regret, you sleep well knowing you're maximizing fulfillment.”

Just take three days out of your life and read these three readings in your 20s and 30s. What you’ll learn will surprise you and you’ll thank yourself looking back 20 years later. 

All these are free to read online and I'm going to link them in the comments.

Musk is not a great thinker. Read Chomsky, Naomi Klein, Arundhati Roy, Rebecca Solnit
