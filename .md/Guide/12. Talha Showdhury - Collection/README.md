Today I discovered a productivity hack that I'm gonna be using a lot.

Save everything.

That's it.

Way too many times we keep repeating writing the same information because we haven't saved it somewhere.

A prime example is, when you submit a job application, you write about why you're a good fit, but when you submit the application, that information is gone.

So avoid writing directly on the application.

Instead, create a Notion or Google Doc page where you dump all you info. Every time you have to write something, you go to that doc and start writing on top of the doc.

This does two thing.

1. Let's you reuse that for other tasks
2. When AI becomes more personalized, you can feed that doc into a personal LLM to enrich its memory and give you answer to any question using your personal info.

So that's it. One doc, for all your writings across the internet.

I can't believe he shared this publicly—pure masterclass for free.
This will be the most high signal/productive activity you do today. 
Let me save you hours worth of work. 
"How to Build with AI" by Andrew Ng [Video in Comment]
Every piece of note below is handwritten by me. No AI summary will get you these details. 
Bookmark this and READ the whole thing.
.
- AI Fund is a startup city, we build about 1 startup a month
- Startups do things at speed
- AI Stack: Semiconducture Companies → Cloud Companies → Foundation Model Companies → Application Layer
- The biggest opportunity is at the application layer because we need to generate enough revenue so they can spend it on the lower infra level
- The biggest tech trend: the rise of agentic AI
- We humans don’t do our best work in a linear way—for example writing a doc from start to finish, neither does AI
- A lot of value is going to be in taking existing workflows and figuring out how to implement that using agentic workflows
- Last year there has been a new layer on top of the foundation model layer: orchestration layer (ex: Langchain)
- At AI fund, we only focus on concrete ideas—concrete ideas buy you speed
- A concrete idea is an idea that describes the idea with enough detail that an engineer can go and build it. For example: not a concrete idea—let’s use AI to automate healthcare assets (different engineers would build this differently, this vagueness takes away your speed); concrete idea—lets build a software using AI to let patiens book MRI machine slots online
- The thing about entrepreneurs is that the vague ideas tend to get a lot of kudos—when you’re vague you’re almost always right
- After you think about an idea for a long time, you can make decisions really quickly—example I thought about online education a lot during building coursera. It’s a surprisingly good mechanism for making quick decisions. That’s why getting a lot of data could be a slow process for startups to make decisions; rather get a subject matter expert with a good gut is often a much better mechanism
- For any successful startups, for any time you’re pursuing one very clear hypothesis
- If data tells you not to pursue that idea, that’s totally fine, go find and build a totally different concrete idea
- The speed of engineering is rapidly going up and the cost of engineering is rapidly going down
- It’s okay for startups to write quick dirty protypes fast that runs only on your machine so you can go build 20 different protypes at once and see which one works
- Jeff bezo’s philosphy: two way door vs one way door. Two way door is where you make a decision and if it goes wrong you can reverse that quickly. One way door is where make a decision that is costly or very difficult to reverse
- Because of agentic coding, my team often now changes tech stack really quickly if it doesn’t work for them
- When we empower everyone to code, a lot of people will be more productive
- One of the most important skill in the future would be knowing how to tell people exactly what to do: prompt engineering. People with a deeper understanding of computers would be able to tell a computer better than a normal person. Same with an art history major would be able to tell a computer better how to generate a better picture than someone who doesn’t know the nuances
- Product management—deciding what product to build is increasingly becoming a bottleneck
- Because engineering has gotten so fast—if you have good tactics to get feedback on how to shape your product, that helps build faster
- Ways to get product feedback: 
1) fastest—play with the product yourself and if you’re a subject matter expert this works really well 
2) slower than 1—ask 3 friends or teammates 
3) slower than 2—ask strangers 
4) Launch full-fledged product A/B test

- If you understand AI really well, that gives you advantage as well. Same with marketing or HR. Teams that understand what AI can do and how well it can do it has an advantage over teams that don’t (ex: how to get a voice out to a low latency)
- Going into the right technical judgement makes the startups go so much faster
- GenAI building blocks: Prompting, Agentic workflows, evals, guardrails, RAG, voice stack, async programming,, data extraction, embeddings/vectorDBs, fine tuning, graphDB with LLMs, agentic browser/computer use, MCP, reasoning models—you could combine these to build amazing softwares that you couldn’t do before
- Deeplearning[dot]ai courses are focused on these building blocks\
- Safety is not a function of electric motor because the maker of the electric motor cannot control how people use it downstream. Same with AI. AI is neither safe or unsafe—it’s how how we use it; responsible AI is a better term for this
- In the AI era when anyone can copy your business: focus on build a product that people love and need. We usually write a 2-6 page memo on building a product before proceeding
- Advice to startup founders: don’t worry about token cost for now; very few companies are lucky enough that users use so much that token cost becomes a problem
- A big edtech change is underway but not here yet. In the next 5-10 years, we’ll be looking to how to transform the education process into an agentic ai workflow
