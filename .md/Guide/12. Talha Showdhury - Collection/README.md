Today I discovered a productivity hack that I'm gonna be using a lot.

Save everything.

That's it.

Way too many times we keep repeating writing the same information because we haven't saved it somewhere.

A prime example is, when you submit a job application, you write about why you're a good fit, but when you submit the application, that information is gone.

So avoid writing directly on the application.

Instead, create a Notion or Google Doc page where you dump all you info. Every time you have to write something, you go to that doc and start writing on top of the doc.

This does two thing.

1. Let's you reuse that for other tasks
2. When AI becomes more personalized, you can feed that doc into a personal LLM to enrich its memory and give you answer to any question using your personal info.

So that's it. One doc, for all your writings across the internet.
