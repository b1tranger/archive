Today I discovered a productivity hack that I'm gonna be using a lot.

Save everything.

That's it.

Way too many times we keep repeating writing the same information because we haven't saved it somewhere.

A prime example is, when you submit a job application, you write about why you're a good fit, but when you submit the application, that information is gone.

So avoid writing directly on the application.

Instead, create a Notion or Google Doc page where you dump all you info. Every time you have to write something, you go to that doc and start writing on top of the doc.

This does two thing.

1. Let's you reuse that for other tasks
2. When AI becomes more personalized, you can feed that doc into a personal LLM to enrich its memory and give you answer to any question using your personal info.

So that's it. One doc, for all your writings across the internet.

I can't believe he shared this publicly—pure masterclass for free.
This will be the most high signal/productive activity you do today. 
Let me save you hours worth of work. 
"How to Build with AI" by Andrew Ng [Video in Comment]
Every piece of note below is handwritten by me. No AI summary will get you these details. 
Bookmark this and READ the whole thing.
.
- AI Fund is a startup city, we build about 1 startup a month
- Startups do things at speed
- AI Stack: Semiconducture Companies → Cloud Companies → Foundation Model Companies → Application Layer
- The biggest opportunity is at the application layer because we need to generate enough revenue so they can spend it on the lower infra level
- The biggest tech trend: the rise of agentic AI
- We humans don’t do our best work in a linear way—for example writing a doc from start to finish, neither does AI
- A lot of value is going to be in taking existing workflows and figuring out how to implement that using agentic workflows
- Last year there has been a new layer on top of the foundation model layer: orchestration layer (ex: Langchain)
- At AI fund, we only focus on concrete ideas—concrete ideas buy you speed
- A concrete idea is an idea that describes the idea with enough detail that an engineer can go and build it. For example: not a concrete idea—let’s use AI to automate healthcare assets (different engineers would build this differently, this vagueness takes away your speed); concrete idea—lets build a software using AI to let patiens book MRI machine slots online
- The thing about entrepreneurs is that the vague ideas tend to get a lot of kudos—when you’re vague you’re almost always right
- After you think about an idea for a long time, you can make decisions really quickly—example I thought about online education a lot during building coursera. It’s a surprisingly good mechanism for making quick decisions. That’s why getting a lot of data could be a slow process for startups to make decisions; rather get a subject matter expert with a good gut is often a much better mechanism
- For any successful startups, for any time you’re pursuing one very clear hypothesis
- If data tells you not to pursue that idea, that’s totally fine, go find and build a totally different concrete idea
- The speed of engineering is rapidly going up and the cost of engineering is rapidly going down
- It’s okay for startups to write quick dirty protypes fast that runs only on your machine so you can go build 20 different protypes at once and see which one works
- Jeff bezo’s philosphy: two way door vs one way door. Two way door is where you make a decision and if it goes wrong you can reverse that quickly. One way door is where make a decision that is costly or very difficult to reverse
- Because of agentic coding, my team often now changes tech stack really quickly if it doesn’t work for them
- When we empower everyone to code, a lot of people will be more productive
- One of the most important skill in the future would be knowing how to tell people exactly what to do: prompt engineering. People with a deeper understanding of computers would be able to tell a computer better than a normal person. Same with an art history major would be able to tell a computer better how to generate a better picture than someone who doesn’t know the nuances
- Product management—deciding what product to build is increasingly becoming a bottleneck
- Because engineering has gotten so fast—if you have good tactics to get feedback on how to shape your product, that helps build faster
- Ways to get product feedback: 
1) fastest—play with the product yourself and if you’re a subject matter expert this works really well 
2) slower than 1—ask 3 friends or teammates 
3) slower than 2—ask strangers 
4) Launch full-fledged product A/B test

- If you understand AI really well, that gives you advantage as well. Same with marketing or HR. Teams that understand what AI can do and how well it can do it has an advantage over teams that don’t (ex: how to get a voice out to a low latency)
- Going into the right technical judgement makes the startups go so much faster
- GenAI building blocks: Prompting, Agentic workflows, evals, guardrails, RAG, voice stack, async programming,, data extraction, embeddings/vectorDBs, fine tuning, graphDB with LLMs, agentic browser/computer use, MCP, reasoning models—you could combine these to build amazing softwares that you couldn’t do before
- Deeplearning[dot]ai courses are focused on these building blocks\
- Safety is not a function of electric motor because the maker of the electric motor cannot control how people use it downstream. Same with AI. AI is neither safe or unsafe—it’s how how we use it; responsible AI is a better term for this
- In the AI era when anyone can copy your business: focus on build a product that people love and need. We usually write a 2-6 page memo on building a product before proceeding
- Advice to startup founders: don’t worry about token cost for now; very few companies are lucky enough that users use so much that token cost becomes a problem
- A big edtech change is underway but not here yet. In the next 5-10 years, we’ll be looking to how to transform the education process into an agentic ai workflow

This is the perfect algorithm to be a cracked Builder/Engineer in 2025. [Free Resources]
Let me spill the secret and all the resources you need for that. 
Step 1: Find a github repository of a project that you find interesting. Or An area that you want to build in. 
Step 2: Use the tools in the comments to study that project throughly to understand how it is implemented in that repo
Step 3: Copy that for your project and make sure you understand how you're implementing that
Step 4: Repeat
This is all you need. Reading code has been the most important aspect of software engineering always. But now it's 100x easier to both read and implement.

# [The Open HUD Challenge](#index)
https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AGGyfo1Xt/

The Open HUD Challenge এর জন্য প্রশ্ন আছে সেটা এখানে করা যাবে। 
যেহেতু workspace ফুল হয়ে গেছে, তাই নতুন করে অন্য কাউকে এড দেয়া যাবেনা। আমি কমেন্টে লিংকটা ওপেন করে দিচ্ছি যারা সল্ভ করতে চায় তাদের জন্য। 
এটা খুবই ইন্টারেস্টিং একটা প্রব্লেম আর প্রত্যেকে এটা ডিফারেন্ট ভাবে সল্ভ করবে। সেরা সল্যুশন গুলো আমি এই পেজ থেকে শেয়ার করবো। এটা সল্ভ করে সেটা যে কারো জন্য একটা নিজের পারসোনাল অটোমেশন টুল হয়ে যাবে।

The Open HUD Challenge: https://www.notion.so/talhachy/The-Open-HUD-Challenge-Build-a-HUD-as-a-High-Signal-Personal-News-Feed-271d2a8a336080eb9069e5b95558da39

### The Open HUD Challenge : Build a HUD as a High Signal Personal News Feed 

What is a HUD UI?

[HUD UI Design Overview](https://claude.ai/share/c722821c-05eb-444f-86c3-dcb64540b68e)

![Gemini_Generated_Image_oehw6joehw6joehw.png](attachment:3fce73f8-02e9-4c0c-8aea-0d352acb6aa9:Gemini_Generated_Image_oehw6joehw6joehw.png)

**This program should accomplish the following goal:** Pull news/posts from the [following](https://www.notion.so/The-Open-HUD-Challenge-Build-a-HUD-as-a-High-Signal-Personal-News-Feed-271d2a8a336080eb9069e5b95558da39?pvs=21) feeds, rank them accroding to my current focus. Show me a auto scrolling list of news with a mix from my current interest and news that are very popular and I should pay attention to.

A minimal implementation of what it’d look like (note this is not what I want): https://claude.ai/share/f3504cef-51c5-46b5-8f5f-8938507898ac

Pull Content from: 

- HackerNews
- Specific Newsletter such as RundownAI, TLDR AI, AI News
- Specific X accounts
- Specific subreddits

Challenge: System design, design decisions, backend structure, and frontend ui for the app, such as: 

- Deciding auto scroll speed
- Deciding how to rank news that are highly popular (what metrics decide popularity?)
- Creating a design of how to show the mix of my current focus area news and other news
- Bookmark management for the news that I decide to save
- Pulling news from bookmarks to show periodically (deciding the frequency)
- and more as they come along

Must needs: 

- Strong state management
- Strong database management across users
- AI pipeline control (ability to put user’s own AI api keys such as openai key for use)
- Tech stack: React, Next.js

**Your Deliverables:**

---

By September 25, 

- If you’re a developer
    
    Build a hud ui for your use using the tech stack above, deploy it to vercel, and share it with me. Make sure to have the app fully functional.
    
- If you’re an AI Engineer
    
    Follow this guide and do as much as you can by the deadline. Share it with me with appropriate tools to showcase, you’ll figure it out. 
    
    ‣ 
    
- If you’re a designer
    
    Design a HUD UI for this usecase that you’ll use it yourself. Share it with me via email with appropriate format that is displayable on the broswer.
    
- If you’re a product person
    
    Write a six-pager product document on this outlining all you can think of in terms of: roadmap, feature ideas, user story, pain points, etc. Your goal is to write a document that outlines how to build the best HUD UI possible. This document should be complete enough so an engineer can go on their own and build it reading the doc without asking any questions.
    
- If you’re anyone else
    
    Build/make whatever you can think of. Use as many tools as your disposals, research, write a paper, etc. There are so many ways you can showcase your skills and going through the process of thinking how to build this product will make you a clearer thinker.


Submissions should be sent to [rubriked@gmail.com](mailto:rubriked@gmail.com), after you submit send me a message on my page’s DM. Your submission should also include a pdf doc outlining how you built it, what resources you used, anything you think an employer should know about.

Here’s an example of a HUD UI built using this project proposal. I recommend not looking at it before you build yours because it’s gonna limit your thinking. But if you really don’t understand the proposal, this is for you. You can also look at it after you’ve made your initial version. Your goal is to give yourself enough creative thinking so everyone’s project becomes a different version. The sky is the limit of what you can do with it.

[hud-ui.vercel.app](https://hud-ui.vercel.app/)

I’ll post a separate post on my page where you can ask as many questions as you want for clarifications. But I’d suggest not to wait for my response, just make up your assumption and build on that assumption.

**The best submissions will get a direct interview to join the first AI Fund in Bangladesh and build Flowsurf and ship other amazing AI products with me.** 

**Not everyone will be able to complete this challenge. That’s where you’ll get ahead! This is what cheat code to life looks like. Go build it!**
