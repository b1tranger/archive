Today I discovered a productivity hack that I'm gonna be using a lot.

Save everything.

That's it.

Way too many times we keep repeating writing the same information because we haven't saved it somewhere.

A prime example is, when you submit a job application, you write about why you're a good fit, but when you submit the application, that information is gone.

So avoid writing directly on the application.

Instead, create a Notion or Google Doc page where you dump all you info. Every time you have to write something, you go to that doc and start writing on top of the doc.

This does two thing.

1. Let's you reuse that for other tasks
2. When AI becomes more personalized, you can feed that doc into a personal LLM to enrich its memory and give you answer to any question using your personal info.

So that's it. One doc, for all your writings across the internet.

I can't believe he shared this publicly‚Äîpure masterclass for free.
This will be the most high signal/productive activity you do today. 
Let me save you hours worth of work. 
"How to Build with AI" by Andrew Ng [Video in Comment]
Every piece of note below is handwritten by me. No AI summary will get you these details. 
Bookmark this and READ the whole thing.
.
- AI Fund is a startup city, we build about 1 startup a month
- Startups do things at speed
- AI Stack: Semiconducture Companies ‚Üí Cloud Companies ‚Üí Foundation Model Companies ‚Üí Application Layer
- The biggest opportunity is at the application layer because we need to generate enough revenue so they can spend it on the lower infra level
- The biggest tech trend: the rise of agentic AI
- We humans don‚Äôt do our best work in a linear way‚Äîfor example writing a doc from start to finish, neither does AI
- A lot of value is going to be in taking existing workflows and figuring out how to implement that using agentic workflows
- Last year there has been a new layer on top of the foundation model layer: orchestration layer (ex: Langchain)
- At AI fund, we only focus on concrete ideas‚Äîconcrete ideas buy you speed
- A concrete idea is an idea that describes the idea with enough detail that an engineer can go and build it. For example: not a concrete idea‚Äîlet‚Äôs use AI to automate healthcare assets (different engineers would build this differently, this vagueness takes away your speed); concrete idea‚Äîlets build a software using AI to let patiens book MRI machine slots online
- The thing about entrepreneurs is that the vague ideas tend to get a lot of kudos‚Äîwhen you‚Äôre vague you‚Äôre almost always right
- After you think about an idea for a long time, you can make decisions really quickly‚Äîexample I thought about online education a lot during building coursera. It‚Äôs a surprisingly good mechanism for making quick decisions. That‚Äôs why getting a lot of data could be a slow process for startups to make decisions; rather get a subject matter expert with a good gut is often a much better mechanism
- For any successful startups, for any time you‚Äôre pursuing one very clear hypothesis
- If data tells you not to pursue that idea, that‚Äôs totally fine, go find and build a totally different concrete idea
- The speed of engineering is rapidly going up and the cost of engineering is rapidly going down
- It‚Äôs okay for startups to write quick dirty protypes fast that runs only on your machine so you can go build 20 different protypes at once and see which one works
- Jeff bezo‚Äôs philosphy: two way door vs one way door. Two way door is where you make a decision and if it goes wrong you can reverse that quickly. One way door is where make a decision that is costly or very difficult to reverse
- Because of agentic coding, my team often now changes tech stack really quickly if it doesn‚Äôt work for them
- When we empower everyone to code, a lot of people will be more productive
- One of the most important skill in the future would be knowing how to tell people exactly what to do: prompt engineering. People with a deeper understanding of computers would be able to tell a computer better than a normal person. Same with an art history major would be able to tell a computer better how to generate a better picture than someone who doesn‚Äôt know the nuances
- Product management‚Äîdeciding what product to build is increasingly becoming a bottleneck
- Because engineering has gotten so fast‚Äîif you have good tactics to get feedback on how to shape your product, that helps build faster
- Ways to get product feedback: 
1) fastest‚Äîplay with the product yourself and if you‚Äôre a subject matter expert this works really well 
2) slower than 1‚Äîask 3 friends or teammates 
3) slower than 2‚Äîask strangers 
4) Launch full-fledged product A/B test

- If you understand AI really well, that gives you advantage as well. Same with marketing or HR. Teams that understand what AI can do and how well it can do it has an advantage over teams that don‚Äôt (ex: how to get a voice out to a low latency)
- Going into the right technical judgement makes the startups go so much faster
- GenAI building blocks: Prompting, Agentic workflows, evals, guardrails, RAG, voice stack, async programming,, data extraction, embeddings/vectorDBs, fine tuning, graphDB with LLMs, agentic browser/computer use, MCP, reasoning models‚Äîyou could combine these to build amazing softwares that you couldn‚Äôt do before
- Deeplearning[dot]ai courses are focused on these building blocks\
- Safety is not a function of electric motor because the maker of the electric motor cannot control how people use it downstream. Same with AI. AI is neither safe or unsafe‚Äîit‚Äôs how how we use it; responsible AI is a better term for this
- In the AI era when anyone can copy your business: focus on build a product that people love and need. We usually write a 2-6 page memo on building a product before proceeding
- Advice to startup founders: don‚Äôt worry about token cost for now; very few companies are lucky enough that users use so much that token cost becomes a problem
- A big edtech change is underway but not here yet. In the next 5-10 years, we‚Äôll be looking to how to transform the education process into an agentic ai workflow

This is the perfect algorithm to be a cracked Builder/Engineer in 2025. [Free Resources]
Let me spill the secret and all the resources you need for that. 
Step 1: Find a github repository of a project that you find interesting. Or An area that you want to build in. 
Step 2: Use the tools in the comments to study that project throughly to understand how it is implemented in that repo
Step 3: Copy that for your project and make sure you understand how you're implementing that
Step 4: Repeat
This is all you need. Reading code has been the most important aspect of software engineering always. But now it's 100x easier to both read and implement.

### Comments
- Deepwiki: Turn any Github Repo Into a Wikipedia (including Diagrams:

### The Open HUD Challenge : Build a HUD as a High Signal Personal News Feed 

What is a HUD UI?

[HUD UI Design Overview](https://claude.ai/share/c722821c-05eb-444f-86c3-dcb64540b68e)

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6b2ecfb-85fa-4ca8-a8be-419fa5b298ec" />

**This program should accomplish the following goal:** Pull news/posts from the [following](https://www.notion.so/The-Open-HUD-Challenge-Build-a-HUD-as-a-High-Signal-Personal-News-Feed-271d2a8a336080eb9069e5b95558da39?pvs=21) feeds, rank them accroding to my current focus. Show me a auto scrolling list of news with a mix from my current interest and news that are very popular and I should pay attention to.

A minimal implementation of what it‚Äôd look like (note this is not what I want): https://claude.ai/share/f3504cef-51c5-46b5-8f5f-8938507898ac

Pull Content from: 

- HackerNews
- Specific Newsletter such as RundownAI, TLDR AI, AI News
- Specific X accounts
- Specific subreddits

Challenge: System design, design decisions, backend structure, and frontend ui for the app, such as: 

- Deciding auto scroll speed
- Deciding how to rank news that are highly popular (what metrics decide popularity?)
- Creating a design of how to show the mix of my current focus area news and other news
- Bookmark management for the news that I decide to save
- Pulling news from bookmarks to show periodically (deciding the frequency)
- and more as they come along

Must needs: 

- Strong state management
- Strong database management across users
- AI pipeline control (ability to put user‚Äôs own AI api keys such as openai key for use)
- Tech stack: React, Next.js

Resources for you

Also search across the internet for HUD examples and implementations

**Your Deliverables:**

---

By September 25, 

- If you‚Äôre a developer
    
    Build a hud ui for your use using the tech stack above, deploy it to vercel, and share it with me. Make sure to have the app fully functional.
    
- If you‚Äôre an AI Engineer
    
    Follow this guide and do as much as you can by the deadline. Share it with me with appropriate tools to showcase, you‚Äôll figure it out. 
    
    ‚Ä£ 
    
- If you‚Äôre a designer
    
    Design a HUD UI for this usecase that you‚Äôll use it yourself. Share it with me via email with appropriate format that is displayable on the broswer.
    
- If you‚Äôre a product person
    
    Write a six-pager product document on this outlining all you can think of in terms of: roadmap, feature ideas, user story, pain points, etc. Your goal is to write a document that outlines how to build the best HUD UI possible. This document should be complete enough so an engineer can go on their own and build it reading the doc without asking any questions.
    
- If you‚Äôre anyone else
    
    Build/make whatever you can think of. Use as many tools as your disposals, research, write a paper, etc. There are so many ways you can showcase your skills and going through the process of thinking how to build this product will make you a clearer thinker.


Submissions should be sent to [rubriked@gmail.com](mailto:rubriked@gmail.com), after you submit send me a message on my page‚Äôs DM. Your submission should also include a pdf doc outlining how you built it, what resources you used, anything you think an employer should know about.

Here‚Äôs an example of a HUD UI built using this project proposal. I recommend not looking at it before you build yours because it‚Äôs gonna limit your thinking. But if you really don‚Äôt understand the proposal, this is for you. You can also look at it after you‚Äôve made your initial version. Your goal is to give yourself enough creative thinking so everyone‚Äôs project becomes a different version. The sky is the limit of what you can do with it. 

---

[hud-ui.vercel.app](https://hud-ui.vercel.app/)

I‚Äôll post a separate post on my page where you can ask as many questions as you want for clarifications. But I‚Äôd suggest not to wait for my response, just make up your assumption and build on that assumption.

**The best submissions will get a direct interview to join the first AI Fund in Bangladesh and build Flowsurf and ship other amazing AI products with me.** 

**Not everyone will be able to complete this challenge. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll get ahead! This is what cheat code to life looks like. Go build it!**

Become an Open Source Master
Open-source software has transformed the tech industry, creating powerful opportunities for learning, growth, and collaboration. By contributing to open-source projects, you can build essential coding skills, gain real-world experience, and make meaningful connections with other developers across the globe.

We just published a course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](http://freecodecamp.org/) YouTube channel that will teach you everything you need to know about contributing to open-source software. Taught by James Pearce, the former Head of Open Source at Meta and the creator of his own open-source project, TinyBase, this course is designed to help you transition from open-source consumer to active contributor. Whether you're just beginning to explore coding or are already an experienced developer, this course will guide you through the key steps to make valuable contributions to open-source projects.

What You'll Learn
By the end of the course, you‚Äôll understand the many rewards of open-source contributions, including opportunities to build your skills, enhance your career, and influence the tech industry. The course starts with open-source fundamentals, covering terms like ‚Äúrepository,‚Äù ‚Äúpull request,‚Äù ‚Äúissues,‚Äù and ‚Äúcommits.‚Äù You‚Äôll learn how to evaluate projects for contribution, find projects that align with your skills and interests, and assess a project‚Äôs health and activity. This knowledge will help you select contributions that are rewarding and impactful.

One of the biggest challenges for new contributors is understanding a new codebase. This course demystifies that process, with practical guidance on identifying the most important parts of a project, understanding its structure, and navigating its social dynamics. You‚Äôll also learn the steps for making and submitting changes, increasing the likelihood that your contributions will be reviewed and accepted quickly. James offers proven strategies to ensure your work is trusted and valued by the project community, paving the way for future contributions.

Here are some key topics covered in this course:

Understanding Open-Source Basics: Learn the terminology and foundational concepts that power the open-source ecosystem.

Identifying Projects to Contribute To: Discover how to find and assess projects that align with your interests and skills.

Navigating a New Codebase: Get strategies to quickly make sense of large codebases and understand where your efforts can have the most impact.

Submitting Your Code: Learn best practices for making commits and submitting pull requests in a way that fosters trust and collaboration.

This course offers a step-by-step roadmap for breaking into open-source, making it easier to contribute confidently and consistently. It‚Äôs a unique opportunity to learn directly from a leader in the field who has dedicated much of his career to open-source advancement.
