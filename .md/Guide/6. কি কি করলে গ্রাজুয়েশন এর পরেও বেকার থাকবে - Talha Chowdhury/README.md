## কি কি করলে গ্রাজুয়েশন এর পরেও বেকার থাকবে? [MUST READ]

I thought about writing this every time I tried to hire someone. The aspects I’m going to address don't really depend on any area of studies. Whether you’re a BBA student, an English language major, or a Computer Science disciple, you’re all going to be unemployed if you follow this routine and make sure to have all of them checked.

---

**No 1. Poor work ethic.** Your ability to complete the job depends on how your mood is on that day, at any particular time. If you don't feel like doing it, you come up with a wide array of brilliant excuses.

---

**No 2. You don’t show up.** You take things so casually like the work doesn’t have any weight on you. You’re the last to be counted on whenever the boss is trying to have the job done on time. If that sounds like you, congrats, you’re unhireable.

---

**No 3. You only meet the bar.** That means, if I need you to do a job, you only do it with bare minimum effort. You don’t think about how to earn the trust of someone through doing excellent work for a while at least. That makes you instantly unattractive compared to other candidates.

---

**No 4. You communicate poorly.** If the manager sends you a task over email, you don’t reply to the task acknowledging its acceptance. You often leave messages seen and reply only when it is a must, not when you should.

---

**No 5. Not being presentable.** Every time you show up, you look like you’ve been through your worst day, just barely woke up, and still one of your legs is in bed. This just shows that you’re not respecting your higher-ups as someone who you have to make efforts for.

---

**No 6. Your resume is trash.** Yes, way too many resumes I look at is pure trash. Wrong format, grammatical errors, unnecessary details, don’t have dates, don’t have numbers, etc. the list goes on. You’re almost instantly rejected just because of your resume. Example of a good resume is attached in the comments.

---

**No 7. No showcase of work.** Charlie Munger once said, the best way to judge someone is just look at their past track record and hire them with any other steps. While other steps are still involved, a past record of success/work is of tremendous importance to make a decision regarding “whether this person can do the job I need”. Think of yourself as an employer of a startup who’s hiring a web developer. Wouldn’t you want to see in the applicant whether they’ve built previous web applications (especially the type that you’re seeking)? Exactly. Put yourself in the employers’ shoes and create a portfolio of work that you will hire yourself with. Here’s where you can learn to build portfolios: [https://www.facebook.com/mdtalhachy/posts/162515249849256](https://www.facebook.com/mdtalhachy/posts/162515249849256)

**No 8. Zero interviewing skills.** Yes, that is the case for most Bangladeshi graduates. I’ve interviewed so many of them and almost none of them can introduce themselves properly, show proper interview etiquette, and know how to answer basic questions. This is where serious work needed to be done. I’m going to attach a resource to learn interviewing in the comments.

I have thousands of resources to address all these skills in my page, [Talha Chowdhury](https://www.facebook.com/mdtalhachy). Just take a month to work on these deficiencies using the resources and keep up with the future posts. I’ll remind you to work on it again।

Teachers are the pioneer of students life. Teachers of Bangladesh in any field mostly have no professional experience which leads them to teaching nothing about professional life after graduation. I completely understand it all should depend on the individual who thrives for the job but the role of a teacher is invaluable in such aspect. I strongly believe one of the requirement to become a professor should be the personal having 2 years of professional experience.
Thank you so much for taking the initiative to guide young soul who are struggling in this tough period.
