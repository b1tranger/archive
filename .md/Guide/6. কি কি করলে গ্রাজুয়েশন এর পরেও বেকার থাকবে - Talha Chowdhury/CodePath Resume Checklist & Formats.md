# **RESUME BEST PRACTICE CHECKLIST:** {#resume-best-practice-checklist:}

***Overall/format:***

- [ ] One page (except for special circumstances like applying for positions outside the US or academic roles)  
- [ ] Do not put a picture on your resume.  
- [ ] Margins should be .5 in. or greater and font should be no smaller than size 11\.  
- [ ] Tailor your content as much as possible to the job posting. No objective.  
- [ ] Single-column format without tables or graphics and in an easily editable format is normally best.

***Contact info:*** 

- [ ] Include: Name, Location (City, ST (abbreviated state), Phone number, Email address (ideally professional Gmail), GitHub URL, [customized LinkedIn URL](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/87/customize-your-public-profile-url?lang=en), & Portfolio/blog link (if you have one & it’s “showable”).

***Education:***

- [ ] Include University, location, full degree name, and planned graduation month and year (ie Bachelor of Science in Computer Science).  
- [ ] You may include up to 2 lines of Relevant Coursework, but make sure it is relevant to the position.  
- [ ] You can include honors, GPA (if above 3.5) or education-related activities in this section if you want.

***Skills (& Certifications):***

- [ ] List skills relevant to position in order of importance. Embed throughout Projects/Experience sections.  
- [ ] Either include your CodePath course here OR as a part of “Relevant Coursework” under Education, or  in a “Relevant Training” section, or under Experience if you have been a Guru or Fellow.

***Experience:*** 

- [ ] Bullet points all start with a *strong* past tense verb and are in the format of [“Accomplished \[X\] as measured by \[Y\] by doing \[Z\]”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140929001534-24454816-my-personal-formula-for-a-better-resume/) or “WHAT you did \+ HOW you did it \+ end RESULT for team/project”.  
- [ ] Should list experiences in reverse chronological order.  
- [ ] Quantitative and qualitative details are added whenever possible to provide evidence of your skill set.

***Projects:*** 

- [ ] Bullet points all start with a *strong* past tense verb and are in the format of [“Accomplished \[X\] as measured by \[Y\] by doing \[Z\]”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140929001534-24454816-my-personal-formula-for-a-better-resume/) or “WHAT you did \+ HOW you did it \+ end RESULT for team/project”.  
- [ ] Focus on describing what you did vs. product description. You’re marketing yourself, not the product.  
- [ ] Add links to project repo (as long as README is good), blog post, deployed project, or app/play store.

***Additional Sections: (Optional)***

- [ ] Additional Experience \+ Relevant Experience: use if you want to separate your work experience into two sections to have your more relevant experience come first.  
- [ ] Leadership Experience/Activities/Community Involvement/Volunteer Experience: include role, organization, location, and dates if possible. Include with or without bullet points.   
- [ ] Honors/Awards: could also highlight accomplishments within each project/experience as a bullet point.  
- [ ] Relevant Training: could include certificates, micro-degrees, immersion opportunities, or CodePath if you don’t want to put it in the Education section.

***Interests: (Optional)***

- [ ] List up to 3 and make them specific, unique, & bonus points for relevant. (Examples: hiking and landscape photography, volunteering with Girls on the Run, and very amateur cake decorating).

# **TIPS FOR STRENGTHENING BULLET POINTS:** {#heading}

***Questions to ask yourself to help you add quantitative and qualitative details:***

* Did you increase test coverage?  
* Did you reduce customer bug tickets?  
* Did you increase platform/product sign-ups?  
* How many installs or users does your product have?  
* What kind of rating does your app maintain?


***Example of strengthening a bullet point:***

| *It’s a start:  Helped write unit tests to identify bugs on the platform* | *Better:  Wrote reusable unit tests to ensure quality control and identify bugs* | *Best: Wrote reusable unit tests to ensure quality control resulting in a 30% reduction of user bug tickets* |
