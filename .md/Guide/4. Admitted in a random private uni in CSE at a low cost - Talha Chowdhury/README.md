"Admitted in a random private uni in CSE at a low cost"

The fact that you're admitted to a private in Bangladesh is a blessing disguised as a struggle. You're gonna get far more time and freedom to pursue a path of your own. Time to be self-directed. Here's what I'd do if I were you:

* **Make a plan for what I wanna become.** There’s no option to explore at this point because of how our educational system is structured. Especially in private uni at BD, the culture isn’t motivating, the peers don't care about classes/education that much, etc. The list goes on. So I have to be laser focused on something. There's only one way ahead.

* **Say I choose to become a software engineer and my goal is to land a software engineer position as soon as I graduate.** Now that I have a goal, everything else is secondary to me.

* **I'll need to divide my 4yrs into different phases.** Here’s what I'll do:

    **1st year, 2nd year:**
    * **Problem solving** (target 600 problems) 300 per year. Following proper strategy to solve problems is important. Look at my previous posts for that.
    * Regularly **participate in online and offline programming contests.** Show up in every regional ICPC no matter what you can solve.
    * Choose **challenging classes and learn everything about that class by yourself, using online resources.** Do not rely on the teacher, do not care about the GPA as long as you pass. Make sure you know these topics: Networking, OS, Database, DSA, AI, and System Design.

    **3rd year, 4th year:**
    * These two years my main goal is to **build something**—could be anything. I'm gonna start building short projects with whatever tech stack is popular and in demand at that time. For example, MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) is the current market leader. Because of my extensive problem solving practice over the last two years, I'll have an easy time learning these tech stacks. For inspiration, I'll find local hackathons and tech fests and build projects for those competitions, focusing on real world problems.
    * I'll **build a network with people in the field.** This could be done in a variety of ways. One is mentioned above that you participate in fests, contests, and over time you'll meet a lot of similar minded individuals. The other is contributing online. There's a lot of Facebook groups dedicated to programming. Helping other people or sharing your knowledge on a consistent basis builds up this network. I'll also start a blog online where I'll share my learnings and try to help others.
    * Near the 4th year, I'll consistently **apply to jobs inside and outside Bangladesh.** The more applications I send, the more chances I'll have. Resume building and interview practice takes a different learning time of its own, so I'll find proper resources for that.

Following this path, I'm 100% confident in my ability that I can land a pretty decent software engineering job inside or outside Bangladesh. If by any chance, I don't, I'll have such an indestructible foundation, that any other path can be built on top of this foundation at any time, no matter how much the industry changes over time.

Resources on every topic I mentioned are on my page, I share regularly, and more of those are gonna come in the future. But it's your responsibility to find those and act on that. The rest will follow.

P.S.: This is my personal opinion on how to get to that goal I mentioned. People can get to a goal following any number of paths. But this is mine and I have full confidence in it because I applied it on myself and achieved desired results. If you're gonna follow this, you'll have to follow it strictly, otherwise you can follow whichever one you feel confident in. But do not mix conflicting advice because that cancels everything to "zero".
